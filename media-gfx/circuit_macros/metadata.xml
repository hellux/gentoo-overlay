		Circuit_macros is a set of macros for drawing high-quality line diagrams to
		include in TeX, LaTeX, web, or similar documents, with support for SVG and
		other formats. Fundamental electric circuit elements and basic logic gates
		based on IEEE and European standards are included, with several tools and
		examples of other types of diagrams. Elements can be scaled or drawn in any
		orientation and are easy to modify. The advantages and disadvantages of such a
		system are similar to those of TeX itself, which is macro-based and
		non-WYSIWYG, with ordinary text input.
